# Well, You're Here.
## This is my collection of ux and technical writing samples.
### Description
I think I'm a writer. I have multiple degrees and hundreds of pages of literary fiction, poetry, and journal entries to prove it. Yet, I feel like I haven't done enough writing in my career, especially within the last 10 years or so, and I want that to change. My goal with this repository is to hold myself accountable while I add documentation artifacts I've created over the years, refresh existing work, and create new samples. The content will include:

- CMS end-user documentation
  - Guides/How-to's
  - FAQs
  - Video Tutorial Transcripts
- User Manuals
- UX microcopy
